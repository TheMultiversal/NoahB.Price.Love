      <h2>Recent Writing</h2>
      <p>Not everything worth saying belongs inside a book.</p>
      <p>Some things surface too close to the nerve.<br>Some thoughts arrive before they can be fully understood.</p>
      <p>Some realizations exist only briefly,<br>and if they are not caught in the moment,<br>they disappear.</p>
      <p>This is where I catch them.</p>
      <p>What you will find here are not answers.<br>They are recognitions.<br>The kind that interrupt you.<br>The kind that feel uncomfortably familiar.<br>Clear. Direct. Sometimes uncomfortable. Always sincere.<br>The kind that make you stop and sit with something<br>longer than you expected to.</p>
      <p>I write here when something demands attention.</p>
      <p>If any of this stays with you after you leave the page,<br>then you already know why it was written.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>What You Will Find Here</h2>
      <p>This journal may include:</p>
      <p>Reflections on writing and the act of paying attention<br>Observations drawn directly from lived experience<br>Explorations of belief, perception, and responsibility<br>Context surrounding current or developing work<br>Thoughts that demand honesty more than certainty</p>
      <p>Some entries are brief. Others unfold gradually. All are written with care for the reader’s time and intelligence.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Recent Entries</h2>
      <p>Below are the most recent pieces. You can begin anywhere. There is no correct order, only what draws your attention now.</p>
      <p>Each entry stands on its own, while remaining in conversation with the rest.</p>

      <h2>An Invitation to Engage</h2>
      <p>You are not asked to agree with what you encounter here.</p>
      <p>You are asked to read attentively.</p>
      <p>If something clarifies a thought you have carried, unsettles an assumption, or names an experience you have not yet put into words, then the writing has done what it was meant to do. Reflection does not require alignment. It requires presence.</p>

      <h2>Stay Connected</h2>
      <p>If you would like to receive new entries, personal notes, or updates on ongoing work, you are welcome to join the mailing list. It is the most direct way to remain connected as the writing continues.</p>
      <p>No excess. No noise.<br>Only what is worth sharing.</p>
