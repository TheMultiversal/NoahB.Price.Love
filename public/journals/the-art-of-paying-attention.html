      <p>Attention<br>
is not a talent.<br>
It is a trained constraint.</p>
      <p>To pay attention is to resist<br>
the default orientation of the mind,<br>
which favors noise, familiarity, and speed.</p>
      <p>What is overlooked is rarely hidden;<br>
it is simply unprotected by novelty.</p>
      <p>Most people do not fail to see.<br>
They fail to remain in stillness.</p>
      <p>Observation requires presence,<br>
but presence is not relaxation.</p>
      <p>It is the deliberate suspension<br>
of internal commentary.</p>
      <p>The mind must be held still<br>
long enough for reality to register<br>
without being immediately interpreted,<br>
categorized, or dismissed.</p>
      <p>What appears ordinary only does so<br>
because it has not been examined<br>
under sustained focus.</p>
      <p>The so-called mundane collapses under attention,<br>
revealing structure, intent, and depth<br>
where none was assumed.</p>
      <p>Attention is therefore not passive awareness.<br>
It is active alignment with what is actually occurring,<br>
rather than with what the mind<br>
prefers to notice.</p>
      <p>To pay attention is to enter<br>
into direct contact with existence,<br>
without mediation, without rehearsal,<br>
and without escape.</p>
