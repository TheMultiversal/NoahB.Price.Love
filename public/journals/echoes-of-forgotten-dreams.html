      <p>Dreams are not experiences.<br>
They are early data.</p>
      <p>What appears in the imagination does not do so arbitrarily.<br>
It arrives as a preliminary structure,<br>
a first exposure to a configuration the mind<br>
is not yet equipped to inhabit.</p>
      <p>When the image fades,<br>
the configuration remains,<br>
embedded below recall.</p>
      <p>Forgetting a dream does not remove its influence,<br>
instead it relocates it.</p>
      <p>The mind converts unfulfilled vision into bias,<br>
orientation, and constraint.<br>
These residues govern behavior<br>
while remaining invisible<br>
to the one governed.</p>
      <p>What is called instinct<br>
is often unfinished imagination.<br>
What is called character is frequently the sediment<br>
of abandoned futures.</p>
      <p>The child who once imagined flight does not<br>
stop reaching upward.</p>
      <p>The image is discarded;<br>
the trajectory is not.</p>
      <p>It persists as impatience with limits,<br>
as a preference for risk,<br>
and as a refusal to accept enclosure as final.</p>
      <p>The artist does not disappear.<br>
The impulse simply ceases to seek expression<br>
and begins to seek necessity,<br>
embedding itself in decisions<br>
that feel inevitable<br>
rather than creative.</p>
      <p>Dreams do not sit behind us as memory.<br>
They stand in front of us as form.</p>
      <p>Choice is frequently nothing more than pressure misidentified,<br>
pulling us toward a shape already known<br>
before comprehension existed.</p>
